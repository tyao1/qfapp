男人的开发框架，走起！

### How to Install
(vpn connection might be required)
```shell
$ npm install gulp -g
$ npm install
```

### How to Build

```shell
$ gulp build                    # or, `gulp build --release`
```

By default, it builds in debug mode. If you need to build in release mode, add
`--release` flag.

### How to Run

```shell
$ gulp                          # or, `gulp --release`
```

This will start a lightweight development server with LiveReload and
synchronized browsing across multiple devices and browsers.

### How to Deploy

```shell
$ gulp deploy                   # or, `gulp deploy --production`
```

You can deploy to different destinations by adding a corresponding flag.
For example `--production` or `--staging` etc. See the 'deploy' task in
`gulpfile.js`.

### How to Test

Run unit tests powered by [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) with the following
[npm](https://www.npmjs.org/doc/misc/npm-scripts.html) command:

```shell
$ npm test
```
